# small_bioinfo
Small scripts for bioinformatics that I might need in the future.


## Scripts
* blast_fasta.py - run remote BLAST on sequences in a FASTA file
* blastxml_gis.py - extract GIs form BLAST result
* translate_fasta.py - translate all frames of nucleotide sequences
* seqs_starting.py - choose only sequences that start with a specific string
* filter_fasta_length.py - choose only sequences that are longer than a threshold value


## Other
* helpers.py - functions used in more than one script
